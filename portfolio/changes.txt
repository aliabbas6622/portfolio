## Issue: React Version Mismatch Error
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')" in chunk-VZJWHPFF.js
- Root Cause: @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei require React 19, but React 18.3.1 was installed
- Solution: Upgrading React and React-DOM to version 19 to match dependency requirements

## Changes Made:
1. Identified version mismatch between React (18.3.1) and @react-three/fiber/drei (requires React 19)
2. Successfully upgraded packages:
   - react: 18.3.1 → 19.2.1
   - react-dom: 18.3.1 → 19.2.1
   - @types/react: 18.3.3 → latest
   - @types/react-dom: 18.3.0 → latest
3. Restarted dev server - Vite re-optimized dependencies
4. Error resolved - all dependencies now compatible

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- Dev server running successfully on http://localhost:5173/
- All React Three Fiber components should now work properly

## Vercel Deployment Fix (2025-12-10 10:04)
**Issue**: Deployment failed with error "vite: command not found"

   - vite: ^5.4.1
   - typescript: ^5.5.3
   - @vitejs/plugin-react: ^4.3.1
   - @types/react: ^19.2.7
   - @types/react-dom: ^19.2.3
2. Committed changes with message: "Fix Vercel deployment: Move build dependencies to production"
3. Pushed to GitHub (commit hash: 977cdcb)
4. Vercel will now automatically redeploy with correct dependencies
