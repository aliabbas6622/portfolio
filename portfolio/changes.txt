## Issue: React Version Mismatch Error
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')" in chunk-VZJWHPFF.js
- Root Cause: @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei require React 19, but React 18.3.1 was installed
- Solution: Upgrading React and React-DOM to version 19 to match dependency requirements

## Changes Made:
1. Identified version mismatch between React (18.3.1) and @react-three/fiber/drei (requires React 19)
2. Successfully upgraded packages:
   - react: 18.3.1 → 19.2.1
   - react-dom: 18.3.1 → 19.2.1
   - @types/react: 18.3.3 → latest
   - @types/react-dom: 18.3.0 → latest
3. Restarted dev server - Vite re-optimized dependencies
4. Error resolved - all dependencies now compatible

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- Dev server running successfully on http://localhost:5173/
- All React Three Fiber components should now work properly

## Server Network Exposure (2025-12-10 09:51)
1. Stopped all running Node.js processes using taskkill command
2. Restarted Vite dev server with --host flag to expose to local network
3. Server now accessible at:
   - Local: http://localhost:5173/
   - Network: http://192.168.1.5:5173/
4. Other devices on the same network can now access the portfolio
